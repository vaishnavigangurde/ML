# Introduction
 The dealing with the Restaurant reviews dataset.
In this dataset, there are reviews from the customers which are either positive or negative. 
And now we are going to build a machine learning model using both Support Vector Classifier(SVC) and Count Vectorizer methods.
And finally, this model is going to predict whether the given review is either positive or negative.

# conclusion
I have  learned how to work on support vector classifier and count vectorizer and also we have seen how to
use both on the model using pipeline and we have created a model which is able to predict whether
the review is positive or negative. We have also seen it using some examples. And we saved the 
model using the joblib and also retrieved it and used back using the joblib.
