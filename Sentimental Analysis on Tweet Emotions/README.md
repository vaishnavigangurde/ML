# Sentimental-analysis
# Introduction

   The dealing with the tweets dataset. In this dataset, contains tweet text with 12 emotions (neutral, worry, happiness, sadness, love, surprise, fun, relief, hate, empty, enthusiasm, boredom and anger) and the goal is to predict the percentage of emotions in a giving text.
And now we are going to build a machine learning model using Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, Support Vector Classifier(SVC) and Count Vectorizer methods.
And finally, this model is going to predict whether the sentiments on given emotions is positive, neutral and negative.

# conclusion

   I have  learned how to work on machine learning models and also we have created a model which is able to predict whether
the sentiment is positive, neutral and negative.
