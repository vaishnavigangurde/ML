# TWEET AUTOMATE SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS
## Introduction

   The dealing with the tweets dataset. This dataset contains tweet text with 12 emotions (neutral, worry, happiness, sadness, love, surprise, fun, relief, hate, empty, enthusiasm, boredom, and anger) and the goal is to predict the percentage of emotions in a given text. And now we are going to build a machine learning model using the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, Support Vector Classifier(SVC), and Count Vectorizer methods. And finally, this model is going to predict whether the sentiments on given emotions are positive, neutral, or negative.

## Conclusion

   I have learned how to work on machine learning models and also we have created a model which is able to predict whether the sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative.
